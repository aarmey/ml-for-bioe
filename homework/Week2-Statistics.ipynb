    "Let us assume that a true distribution of a process is described by the normal distribution with $\\mu=5$ and $\\sigma=1$. You have a measurement technique that allows you to sample n points from this distribution. In Python we can use a random number generator whose numbers will be chosen from the desired normal distribution by using the function `np.random.normal`. Sample from this normal distribution from n=1 to 50 (i.e. n=1:50). Create a plot for the standard deviation of the calculated mean from each n when you repeat the sampling 1000 times each.
