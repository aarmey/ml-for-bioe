# Bugs and Testing

- **software reliability**: Probability that a software system will not cause failure under specified conditions.
	- Measured by uptime, MTTF (mean time till failure), crash data.

- Bugs are inevitable in any complex software system.
	- Industry estimates: 10-50 bugs per 1000 lines of code.
	- A bug can be visible or can hide in your code until much later.

- testing: A systematic attempt to reveal errors.
	- Failed test: an error was demonstrated.
	- Passed test: no error was found (for this particular situation).

# Cost-benefit tradeoff

## There is no one answer to testing

- You're putting together a quick script to calculate the amount of a chemical you need
	- You probably don't need to test this
- You're assembling a machine learning model to identify heart attacks
	- Not testing this could be considered professional malpractice

# Difficulties of testing

- Testing is seen as a novice's job.
	- Assigned to the least experienced team members.
	- Done as an afterthought (if at all).
	- "My code is good; it won't have bugs.  I don't need to test it."
	- "I'll just find the bugs by running the program."
- Limitations of what testing can show you:
	- It is impossible to completely test a system.
	- Testing does not always directly reveal the actual bugs in the code.
	- Testing does not prove the absence of errors in software.

# Unit Testing

**unit testing**: Looking for errors in a subsystem in isolation.
	- Generally a "subsystem" means a particular class or object.

The basic idea:

- For a given class Foo, create another class FooTest to test it, containing various "test case" methods to run.
- Each method looks for particular results and passes / fails.
- Put assertion calls in your test methods to check things you expect to be true.  If they aren't, the test will fail.

# Python's unittest

```python
import unittest

class TestStoneMethods(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_nchoosek(self):
        self.assertTrue(nchoosek(5)[3] == 10)
        self.assertTrue(nchoosek(6)[3] == 20)
        self.assertTrue(nchoosek(7)[3] == 35)
        self.assertTrue(nchoosek(8)[3] == 56)
        self.assertTrue(nchoosek(9)[3] == 84)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

# Setup and Teardown

```python
import unittest
from ..StoneModel import StoneModel

class TestStoneMethods(unittest.TestCase):
    def setUp(self):
        self.M = StoneModel()

    def test_dataImport_mfiAdjMean(self):
        self.assertTrue(self.M.mfiAdjMean.shape == (24, 8))
```

# Tips for Testing

- You cannot test every possible input, parameter value, etc.
	- So you must think of a limited set of tests likely to expose bugs.
- Think about boundary cases
	- positive; zero; negative numbers
	- right at the edge of an array or collection's size
- Think about empty cases and error cases
	- 0, -1, null;  an empty list or array
- test behavior in combination
	- maybe add usually works, but fails after you call remove
	- make multiple calls;  maybe size fails the second time only

# Trustworthy tests

- Test one thing at a time per test method
	- 10 small tests are much better than 1 test 10x as large
- Each test method should have few (likely 1) assert statements
	- If you assert many things, the first that fails stops the test
	- You won't know whether a later assertion would have failed
- Tests should avoid logic
	- Minimize if/else, loops, switch, etc.
	- Avoid try/catch
	- If it's supposed to throw, use assert for that

Torture tests are okay, but only *in addition to* simple tests.

# Regression testing

- **regression**: When a feature that used to work, no longer works.
	- Likely to happen when code changes and grows over time.
	- A new feature/fix can cause a new bug or reintroduce an old bug.

- **regression testing**: Re-executing prior unit tests after a change.
	- Often done by scripts during automated testing.
	- Used to ensure that old fixed bugs are still fixed.

Many products have a set of mandatory check-in tests that must pass before code can be added to a source code repository.

# Test-driven development

- Unit tests can be written after, during, or even before coding.
	- **test-driven development**: Write tests, then write code to pass them.

- Imagine that we'd like to add a method `subtractWeeks` to a `Date` class, that shifts this Date backward in time by the given number of weeks.

- Write code to test this method before it has been written.
- Then once we do implement the method, we'll know if it works.


# Things to avoid in unit tests

- Tests should be self-contained and not care about each other.

Avoid:

- Constrained test order
	- Test A must run before Test B.
	- Usually a misguided attempt to test order/flow.
- Tests call each other
	- Test A calls Test B's method
	- Calling a shared helper is OK, though
- Mutable shared state
	- Tests A/B both use a shared object.
	- If A breaks it, what happens to B?

# Testing summary

- Tests need failure atomicity  (ability to know exactly what failed).
	- Each test should have a clear, long, descriptive name.
	- Assertions should always have clear messages to know what failed.
	- Write many small tests, not one big test.
	- Each test should have roughly just a couple assertions at its end.
- Test for expected errors / exceptions.
- Choose a descriptive assert method, not always assertTrue.
- Choose representative test cases from equivalent input classes.
- Avoid complex logic in test methods if possible.
- Use helpers, setup functions to reduce redundancy between tests.

# Reproducible builds

- One element that unit testing highlights is the contribution of randomness
	- For example, if we start optimization at a random point, something might just break 1% of the time
	- This makes it challenging to identify when something breaks
	- Often, to avoid this, random number generators are set to a constant seed
	- But, keep in mind this then only tests one outcome of this value

# Reproducible builds

- Other source of variation: the code surrounding your analysis
	- E.g. `seaborn` package changes the way it orders colors on a graph
	- A solution to this is `virtualenv`
		- This is a package that creates a virtual environment to run your python code
		- Can avoid anything someone else might have installed / messed with
	- Often projects will have a `requirements.txt` file
		- Stores the names *and versions* of all the packages used
		- Then can install specifically these before doing anything

# Containerization

- What about Linux vs. Windows vs. MacOS differences? Time differences? "Gremlins"?
- Way to get around this variability is to make sure **everything** else in the environment stays constant
	- One way to do this is with a container
	- E.g. docker, which downloads and runs a virtual machine
- Essentially you start up a "virtual computer", then install everything you need

# Integration testing

- **integration**: Combining 2 or more software units
	- often a subset of the overall project  (!= system testing)

- Why do software engineers care about integration?
	- new problems will inevitably surface
		- many systems now together that have never been before
	- if done poorly, all problems present themselves at once
		- hard to diagnose, debug, fix
	- cascade of interdependencies
		- cannot find and solve problems one-at-a-time

# Two Approaches To Integration

- **phased ("big-bang") integration**:
	- design, code, test, debug each class/unit/subsystem separately
	- combine them all
	- hope it all comes together
- **incremental integration**:
	- develop a functional "skeleton" system
	- design, code, test, debug a small new piece
	- integrate this piece with the skeleton
	- test/debug it before adding any other pieces

# Benefits Of Incremental

- Benefits:
	- Errors easier to isolate, find, fix
		- reduces developer bug-fixing load
	- System is always in a (relatively) working state

- Drawbacks:
	- May need to create "stub" versions of some features that have not yet been integrated
	- Not always possible

# When To Build

- daily build: Compile working executable on a daily basis
	- allows you to test the quality of your integration so far
	- helps morale; product "works every day"; visible progress
	- best done *automated* or through an easy script
	- quickly catches/exposes any bug that breaks the build
- smoke test: A quick set of tests run on the daily build.
	- NOT exhaustive; just sees whether code "smokes" (breaks)
	- used (along with compilation) to make sure daily build runs
- continuous integration:
	- Adding new units immediately as they are written.

# Associated topics - Property-based testing

- Property-based testing is a slight variant of unit testing
	- Rather than specifying an exact program to run, you specify some properties that should hold
	- e.g. if C = f(A, B), C > B and C > A
- Methods exist to test whether this is true, and do it in a way that is more efficient than trying random values
- `hypothesis` is a python package for this

# Associated topics - Fuzzing

- Let's say you have a function that reads in some random data from the internet then processes it
	- You want to make sure it won't crash no matter what's sent to it
- Fuzzing is the process of sending all sorts of random data to a program, to make sure it keeps working
	- "Working" can be not crashing, but also that you still get some proper output
- Tools like afl (American Fuzzy Lop) can peer into your program to actively look for random inputs to make it behave differently
- Packages like `datafuzz` can perform the data equivalent—i.e. add noise, etc, that shouldn't influence the analysis

# Associated topics - Linting

- It's possible to write a program that is correct and runs, but just isn't written well
	- E.g. Hard to read
	- Fails to follow best practices
	- The interpreter/compiler figures it out, but it's a bad idea
- For example: `pythonfunctioniwrotemyselfonasundayafterwaytoomuchcoffee(argument = False)`
- Linters are programs to check various rules about how code should be written
- Can also use static analysis to determine potential errors
- `pylint` is a linter for python code

# Summary

- For complex analysis make sure to use unit testing
- Exactly what testing is necessary or helpful depends on the problem at hand
- More testing isn't as important as better testing
- For multi-part problems, it's important to think of all the factors affecting your outcome
