# The evils of "hard" assignments

## The evils of "hard" assignments

- Clusters may overlap
- Some clusters may be “wider” than others
- Distances can be deceiving!

::: {.notes}
If we know which points are in each cluster, the answer is easy! (mu, sigma)

## Probabilistic clustering

- Try a probabilistic model!
	- Allows overlaps, clusters of different size, etc.
- Can tell a *generative story* for data
	- $P(X\mid Y) P(Y)$
- Challenge: need to estimate model parameters without labeled `Y`s

## Probabilistic clustering

| Y  | $X_1$ | $X_2$ |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| ?? | 0.1 | 2.1 |
| ?? | 0.5 | -1.1 |
| ?? | 0.0 | 3.0 |
| ?? | -0.1 | -2.0 |
| ?? | 0.2 | 1.5 |
| ... | ... | ... |

## The general GMM assumption

- $P(Y)$: There are k clusters/components
- $P(X\mid Y)$: Each component generates data from a *multivariate Gaussian* with mean $\mu_i$ and covariance matrix $\Sigma_i$

Each data point is sampled from a **generative process**:

1. Choose component i with probability $P(y=i)$
2. Generate datapoint $N(m_i, \Sigma_i)$

## What model should we use?

- Depends on X.
- If we know which points are in a cluster, then we can define the best distribution for it.
	- Multinomial over clusters Y
	- (Independent) Gaussian for each $X_i$ given Y

$$p(Y_i = y_k) = \theta_k$$

$$P(X_i = x \mid Y = y_k) = N(x \mid \mu_{ik}, \sigma_{ik})$$

## Could we make fewer assumptions?

- **Gaussian Mixture Models!**
	- $P(Y)$ still multinormal
	- $P(\mathbf{X}\mid Y)$ is a *multivariate* Gaussian distribution:

Shown is the posterior probability that a point was generated from $i$th Gaussian: $Pr(Y = i \mid x)$

## ML estimation in **supervised** setting

- Univariate Gaussian

$$\mu_{MLE} = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N x_i \quad\quad \sigma_{MLE}^2 = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N (x_i -\hat{\mu})^2$$

- **Mixture** of **Multi**variate Gaussians
	- ML estimate for each of the Multivariate Gaussians is given by:

$$\mu_{ML}^k = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{j=1}^n x_n \quad\quad \Sigma_{ML}^k = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{j=1}^n \left(\mathbf{x}_j - \mu_{ML}^k\right)  \left(\mathbf{x}_j - \mu_{ML}^k\right)^T$$

Just sums over $x$ generated from the $k$'th Gaussian

## But what if unobserved data?

![ ](./figs/gmms/gm19.webp)

## But what if unobserved data?

- MLE: $\arg\max_\theta \prod_j P(y_i, x_j)$
	- $\theta$: all model parameters
		- e.g., class probs, means, and variances
	- But we don't know $y_j$'s!
- Maximize **marginal likelihood**:
	- $\arg\max_\theta \prod_j P(x_j) = \arg\max_\theta \prod_j \sum_{k=1}^K P(Y_j=k, x_j)$

# How do we optimize? Closed Form?

- Maximize **marginal likelihood**: $$\arg\max_{\theta} \prod_j P(x_j) = \arg\max \prod_j \sum_{k=1}^K P(Y_j=k, x_j)$$
- Almost always a hard problem!
	- Usually no closed form solution
	- Even when lgP(X,Y) is convex, lgP(X) generally isn’t...
	- For all but the simplest P(X), we will have to do gradient ascent, in a big messy space with lots of local optima...

## Learning general mixtures of Gaussians

$$P(y = k | \mathbf{x}_j) \propto \frac{1}{(2\pi)^{n/2} ||\Sigma_k||^{1/2}} \exp\left[-\frac{1}{2}(\mathbf{x}_j - \mu_k)^T \Sigma_k^{-1}(\mathbf{x}_j - \mu_k)\right]P(y = k)$$

- Marginal likelihood:
$$\prod_{j=1}^m P(\mathbf{x}_j) = \prod_{j=1}^m \sum_{k=1}^K P(\mathbf{x}_j, y = k)$$
$$= \prod_{j=1}^m \sum_{k=1}^K \frac{1}{(2\pi)^{n/2} ||\Sigma_k||^{1/2}} \exp\left[-\frac{1}{2}(\mathbf{x}_j - \mu_k)^T \Sigma_k^{-1}(\mathbf{x}_j - \mu_k)\right]P(y = k)$$

- Need to differentiate and solve for $\mu_k$, $\sum_k$, and P(Y=k) for k=1..K
- There will be no closed form solution, gradient is complex, lots of local optimum
- **Wouldn’t it be nice if there was a better way!?!**

# EM

## Expectation Maximization

# The EM Algorithm

- A clever method for maximizing marginal likelihood:
	- $\arg\max_{\theta} \prod_j P(x_j) = \arg\max_{\theta} \prod_j \sum_{k=1}^K P(Y_j=k, x_j)$
	- A type of gradient ascent that can be easy to implement
		- e.g. no line search, learning rates, etc.
- Alternate between two steps:
	- Compute an expectation
	- Compute a maximization
- Not magic: **still optimizing a non-convex function with lots of local optima**
	- The computations are just easier (often, significantly so!)
	- Especially useful when the E and M steps have closed form solutions!

## Simple(r) example: learn means only!

::: columns

:::: {.column width=50%}
Consider:

- 1D data
- Mixture of k=2 Gaussians
- Variances fixed to $\sigma=1$
- Uniform distribution over classes
- Just need to estimate $\mu_1$ and $\mu_2$

$$
\prod_{j=1}^{m}\sum_{k=1}^{K} P(x,Y_{j} = k) \propto \prod_{j=1}^{m}\sum_{k=1}^{K=2}\exp\left[-\frac{1}{2\sigma^{2}} \| x - \mu_{k} \|^{2}\right] P(Y_{j}=k)
$$

## EM for GMMs: only learning means

On the `t`'th iteration let our estimates be: $\lambda_t = \{ \mu_1^{(t)}, \mu_2^{(t)} ... \mu_K^{(t)} \}$

### E-step

Compute "expected" classes of all datapoints

$$P(Y_j = k|x_j, \mu_1 ... \mu_K) \propto \exp(-\frac{1}{2\sigma^2}\|x_j - \mu_k\|^2)P(Y_j = k)$$

### M-step

Compute most likely new $\mu$s given class expectations

$$\mu_k = \frac{\sum_{j=1}^{m} P(Y_j = k|x_j) x_j}{\sum_{j=1}^{m} P(Y_j = k|x_j)}$$


## What if we do hard assignments?

On the t'th iteration let our estimates be $\lambda_t = \{ \mu_1^{(t)}, \mu_2^{(t)} ... \mu_K^{(t)} \}$

### E-step

Compute “expected" classes of all datapoints

$$P(Y_j = k | x_j, \mu_1...\mu_K) \propto \exp(-\frac{1}{2\sigma^2}\|x_j - \mu_k\|^2)$$

## What if we do hard assignments?

On the t'th iteration let our estimates be $\lambda_t = \{ \mu_1^{(t)}, \mu_2^{(t)} ... \mu_K^{(t)} \}$

### M-step

Compute most likely new $\mu$s given class expectations
$$\mu_k = \frac{\sum_{j=1}^m \delta(Y_j=k,x_j)x_j}{\sum_{j=1}^m \delta(Y_j=k,x_j)}$$

$\delta$ represents hard assignment to “most likely” or nearest cluster

Equivalent to k-means clustering algorithm!!!

# E.M. for General GMMs

## General GMMs: Setup

**Iterate:** On the $t$'th iteration let our estimates be

$$ \lambda_t = \{ \mu_1^{(t)}, \mu_2^{(t)} ... \mu_K^{(t)}, \Sigma_1^{(t)}, \Sigma_2^{(t)} ... \Sigma_K^{(t)}, p_1^{(t)}, p_2^{(t)} ... p_K^{(t)} \} $$

$p_k^{(t)}$ is shorthand for estimate of $P(y=k)$ on $t$'th iteration

## General GMMs: E-step

Compute "expected" classes of all datapoints for each class

$$ P(Y_j = k|x_j, \lambda_t) \propto p_k^{(t)}p(x_j|\mu_k^{(t)}, \Sigma_k^{(t)}) $$
Just evaluate a Gaussian at $x_j$

## General GMMs: M-step

Compute weighted MLE for $\mu$ given expected classes above

$$ \mu_k^{(t+1)} = \frac{\sum_j P(Y_j = k|x_j,\lambda_t)x_j}{\sum_j P(Y_j = k|x_j,\lambda_t)} $$

$$ \Sigma_k^{(t+1)} = \frac{\sum_j P(Y_j = k|x_j,\lambda_t) [x_j - \mu_k^{(t+1)}][x_j - \mu_k^{(t+1)}]^T}{\sum_j P(Y_j = k|x_j,\lambda_t)} $$

$$ p_k^{(t+1)} = \frac{\sum_j P(Y_j = k|x_j,\lambda_t)}{m} $$

$m$ is the number of training examples

## Review Questions

1. What are two ways in which GMMs give different results from K-means?
2. What does it mean to say GMMs produce “soft assignment”?
3. What can you say about a multivariate normal distribution with only diagonal elements?
4. What does it mean to say a GMM is a generative model?
5. Can mixture models be produced from distributions other than a Gaussian? If so, how is the distribution defined within the model? If not, why?
6. Can GMMs describe clusters of non-Gaussian shapes? (Think of the moon example from lecture.) Describe.
7. Can a GMM identify overlapping clusters? If so, what “signal” does it use in the data to distinguish these? If not, why not?
8. A point lies equidistant between two clusters in a dataset. How do you expect this point to be clustered when using a GMM? How about with K-means?
