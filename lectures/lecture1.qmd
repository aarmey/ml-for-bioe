# Introduction

## How do we need to learn about the world?

- What is a measurement?
- What is a model?

::: {.notes}
- Measurement: Observation about the world.
- Model: Theoretical explanation of the world.
- **Everything** is a model. Cover qualitative models.
:::

## Three things we need to learn about the world

- Measurements (data)
- Models (inference)
- Algorithms

::: {.notes}
Distinguish each of these.
:::

## Area of Focus

What we will cover spans a range of fields:

- Engineering (the data)
- Computational techniques (the algorithms)
- Statistics (the model)

::: {.notes}
- Makes this material challenging.
- Also rewarding, frontier of methods.
- Stop and talk about why statistics can be hard.
- One, students haven't seen it before.
- Two, it has both a mathematical and philosophical element.
:::

## Why do we need models to learn about the world?

::: {.notes}
- It may not be feasible for humans to learn on the scale / in the time alloted.
- Model construction serves as goal posts. I.e. a well-specified target we can compare, share, etc.
- For many tasks, machine learning can perform better than a human would.

## Comparisons

- Multiscale nature
	- Biology operates on many scales
	- Same is true for electronics
	- **But** electronics employ compartmentalization/abstraction to make understandable
- Component-wise understanding
	- Only provides basic characterization
	- Leads to "context-dependent" function

# Basic Statistical Concepts

## Data

- What is a variable?
- What is an observation?
- What is N?

## Types of variables

- Categorical
- Numerical/continuous
- Ordinal

## Probability

::: {.notes}
- Probability indicates the chance of an event within a wider set of outcomes
- Also talk about if something is conditionally dependent/independent
- What is integral?
- What is limit as dx goes to 0?
:::

## Coin toss example

A set of trials: HTHHHTTHHTT

Two possibilities:

- Fair coin (heads 50%, tails 50%)
- Biased (heads 60%, tails 40%)

::: {.notes}
- Run through example.
- What is the data here?
- What is the model?
- What is the algorithm?
- Walk through each form of probability.
- Probabilities are 0.00049 fair, 0.00048 biased.
:::

## Distributions

We've already been talking about these! Distributions describe the range of probabilities that exist for all possible outcomes.

::: {.notes}
- Choice of distribution implies a specific underlying process.
- Can a distribution be categorical? Ordinal? Numerical?
:::

## Other Probabilities

Conditional probability
~ The measure of an event given that another event has occured.

Marginal distribution
~ The probability distribution regardless of other observations/factors.

Joint probability
~ In a multivariate probability space, the distribution for more than one variable.

Complementary event
~ The probability of an event not occuring.

::: {.notes}
- Plot out a joint probability
- Also talk about if something is conditionally dependent/independent
:::

## Normal Distributions

- $\mu$: center of the distribution
- $\sigma$: standard deviation
- $\sigma^2$: variance

$$f(x)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}\; e^{-\frac{x^2}{2}}$$

![ ](./figs/lec1/normal_pdf.png){width=2in}

## Normal Distributions

For a *standard* normal distribution ($\mu = 0$, $\sigma = 1$):

$$f(x)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}\; e^{-\frac{x^2}{2}}$$

Area between:

- One standard deviation: 68%
- Two stdev: 95%
- Three stdev: 99.7%

You can normalize any normal distribution to the standard normal.

::: {.notes}
- Walk through the equations for normal distribution.
- Walk through process of Z-scoring.
:::

## Other Distributions

Normal Distribution
~ Describes many naturally observed variables and has statistics mean and standard deviation.

Exponential Distribution
~ Describes the time between events in Poisson processes.

Poisson
~ Stochastic process that counts events in some time frame.

Gamma
~ Used in Bayesian statistics, often for modeling waiting times.

Bernoulli
~ Like a coin flip. Binary outcome.

Binomial
~ Describes the number of successes in a sequence of Bernoulli trials.

Multinomial
~ Generalization of Binomial for more than two states.

## Distribution moments

The moments of a distribution describe its shape: $$\mu_{n}=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}(x-c)^{n}\,f(x)\,\mathrm{d} x$$

- Mean ($n=1$), variance ($n=2$), skewness ($n=3$), kertosis ($n=4$)
- Essential properties to determining how data will behave during analysis:
	- How might your measurements need to change with changes in variance?
	- What are these values for a normal distribution?

# Sample statistics

## Sample statistics

If we sampled a number of times ($n=3$, say) many times, we could build a **sampling** distribution of the statistics (e.g., one for the **sample** mean and one for the **sample** standard deviation).

General properties of sampling distributions:

1. The sampling distribution of a statistic often tends to be centered at the value of the population parameter estimated by the statistics
2. The spread of the sampling distributions of many statistics *tends* to grow smaller as sample size $n$ increases
3. As $n$ increases, sampling distributions tends towards normality. If a process has mean $\mu$ and standard deviation $\sigma$, them the sample mean ($\mu$) and the sample standard deviation ($\sigma / \sqrt{n}$)

## Sample statistics

- This means that as $n$ increases, the better estimate $\mu_x$ is of $\mu$.
	- Sample standard deviation is the standard deviation of the mean.
- When a population distribution is normal, the sampling distribution of the sample statistic is also normal, regardless of $n$.
- And the central limit theorem states that the sampling distribution can be approximated by a normal distribution when the sample size, $n$, is sufficiently large.
- Rule of thumb is that $n=30$ is sufficiently large, but there are times when smaller $n$ will suffice. Greater $n$ is required with higher **skew**.

## Hypothesis Testing

In hypothesis testing, we state a null hypothesis that we will test; if its likelihood is less than some value, then we reject it.

For example:

- $H_0$: A particular set of points come from a normal distribution with mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma$.
- $H_0$: Two sets of observations were sampled from distributions with different means.

When we do an experiment, we typically take a **sampling** of several observations, to be more certain of the result.

::: {.notes}
- Go over this, drawing out distributions.
- Go over one sided, two sided tests.
:::

## T-distribution

When $n$ is small use the t-distribution with $n-1$ degrees of freedom.

- $H_0$: Assume $\mu=\mu_0$ then calculate t. $$t = \frac{\overline{x} - \mu_0}{s/\sqrt{n}}$$
	- Can think of $t$ designed to be $z/s$, where it’s sensitive to the magnitude of the difference to the alternate hypothesis and scaled to control for the spread.
- When comparing the differences between two means: (null hypothesis the means are the same, variances/sizes assumed equal). $$t=\frac{{\bar{X}}_1-{\bar{X}}_2}{\sqrt{\frac{s_{X_1}^2+s_{X_2}^2}{n}}}$$

## Effect size

- The scalar factor scales the t-value
	- If normal data, the sample distribution variance scales as $1 / \sqrt{n}$
	- p-values become significant even with small difference in means
- Exercise caution and report the effect size
	- For example, a 1% or 50% difference in the means

## Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test

- Comparison of an empirical distribution function with the distribution function of the hypothesized distribution.
- Does not depend on the grouping of data.
- Relatively insensitive to outlier points (i.e., distribution tails).

## Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test

- K-S test is most useful when the sample size is small
- Geometric meaning of the test statistic:

![ ](./figs/lec1/ks.jpg){width=2in}

::: {.notes}
No t-distribution available here.
:::

## Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test Statistic

This is the operation that creates the sample distribution.

$$D_n^{+} = \max_{1\leq i\leq n} \left(\frac{i}{n} - \hat{F}(X_{(i)})\right)$$
$$D_n^{-} = \max_{1\leq i\leq n} \left(\hat{F}(X_{(i)}) - \frac{i - 1}{n}\right)$$
$$D_n = \max \left( D_n^{+}, D_n^{-} \right)$$

Not expressed in one equation with absolute value because distance is assessed from opposite ends for each.

How is this then converted to a p-value?

## Graphical Analysis

- Plotting a distribution is often more informative than a test.
- Not only assesses deviation, but can explain where it occurs.
- Many variants:
	- [Q-Q plot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q%E2%80%93Q_plot)
	- [P-P plot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P%E2%80%93P_plot)
	- Histogram with fitted distribution

## Testing errors

- Type I error: error of rejecting $H_0$ when it is true (false positive)
- Type II error: not rejecting $H_0$ when it is false (false negative)
- Alpha: significance level in the long run $H_0$ would be rejected this amount of the time falsely (i.e., we are willing to accept $x$ fraction of false positives)

Beware of goodness-of-fit tests because they are unlikely to reject *any* distribution with little data, and are very sensitive to the smallest systematic error with lots of data.

## Multiple hypotheses

We want to test whether the gene expression between two cells differs greater than chance alone. We test the two samples with a p-value cutoff of 0.05:

- How many false positives would we expect after testing 20 genes?
- How about 1000 genes?

What about false negatives?

What does this mean when it comes to hypothesis testing?

## Review Questions

1. What are 4 reasons to build a model?
2. $p(x) = a/x$ for $1 < x < 10$ describes a distribution pdf. What is $a$? What is the expression for the distribution mean?
3. What are the three kinds of variables? Give an example of each.
4. You are interested in the sample distribution of the mean for an exponential distribution (N=8). What can you say about it relative to the original one?
5. What can you say about the sample distribution for the N=1 case?
6. Studying an anti-tumor compound, you create 2 tumors in either flank (i.e. 1 mouse gets 2 tumors) of 5 mice, then treat the animals with a compound, measuring tumor growth. What is N? Justify your answer.
7. You want to model a process where each successive outcome is 1/5 as likely (e.g., getting 3 is 1/5 as likely as getting 2). What is the expression for this distribution?
