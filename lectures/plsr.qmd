## Notes about the methods today

- Both methods are supervised learning methods, however have a number of distinct properties from others we will discuss.
- Learning about PLS is more difficult than it should be, partly because papers describing it span areas of chemistry, economics, medicine and statistics, with differences in terminology and notation.

## Regularization

- Both PCR and PLSR are forms of regularization.
- Reduce the dimensionality of our regression problem to $N_{\textrm{comp}}$.
- Prioritize certain variance in the data.

# Principal Components Regression

## Principal Components Regression

One solution: use the concepts from PCA to reduce dimensionality.

First step: **Simply apply PCA!**

Dimensionality goes from $m$ to $N_{comp}$.

::: {.notes}
- What are the bounds on the number of components we can have?
- What might be a concern as a consequence of this? (How do we determine how many components to keep?)
:::

## Principal Components Regression

1)  Decompose X matrix (scores T, loadings P, residuals E)
$$X = TP^T + E$$

2) Regress Y against the scores (scores describe observations – by using them we link X and Y for each observation)

$$Y = TB + E$$

::: {.notes}
- What is the residual against here?
:::

## How do we determine the right number of components to use for our prediction?

::: {.notes}
- Cross-validation with varying numbers of components
:::

## A remaining potential problem

The PCs for the X matrix do not necessarily capture X-variation that is important for Y.

We might *miss* later PCs that are important for prediction!

# Partial Least Squares Regression

## The core idea of PLSR

What if, instead of maximizing the variance explained in X, we maximize the **co**variance explained between X and Y?

::: {.notes}
- Go over definition of covariance.
- cov(X, X) = var(X)
- var(Y) = cov(X, Y) + variance in Y independent of X
- A factorization occurs to find max covar with Y
- Forces direction of components
:::

## What is covariance?


## PLSR is a cross-decomposition method

We will find principal components for both X and Y:

$$X = T P^t + E$$

$$Y = U Q^t + F$$

## NIPALs while exchanging the scores

1. Take a random column of Y to be $u_a$, and regress it against X.

$$\mathbf{w}_a = \dfrac{1}{\mathbf{u}'_a\mathbf{u}_a} \cdot \mathbf{X}'_a\mathbf{u}_a$$

## NIPALs while exchanging the scores

2. Normalize $w_a$.

$$\mathbf{w}_a = \dfrac{\mathbf{w}_a}{\sqrt{\mathbf{w}'_a \mathbf{w}_a}}$$

## NIPALs while exchanging the scores

3. Regress $w_a$ against $X^T$ to obtain $t_a$.

$$\mathbf{t}_a = \dfrac{1}{\mathbf{w}'_a\mathbf{w}_a} \cdot \mathbf{X}_a\mathbf{w}_a$$

## NIPALs while exchanging the scores

4. Regress $t_a$ against Y to obtain $c_a$.

$$\mathbf{c}_a = \dfrac{1}{\mathbf{t}'_a\mathbf{t}_a} \cdot \mathbf{Y}'_a\mathbf{t}_a$$

![https://learnche.org/pid/latent-variable-modelling/projection-to-latent-structures/how-the-pls-model-is-calculated](./figs/plsr/NIPALS-iterations-PLS.png)

## NIPALs while exchanging the scores

5. Regress $c_a$ against $Y^T$ to obtain $u_a$.

$$\mathbf{u}_a = \dfrac{1}{\mathbf{c}'_a\mathbf{c}_a} \cdot \mathbf{Y}_a\mathbf{c}_a$$

## NIPALs while exchanging the scores

5. Cycle until convergence, then subtract off variance explained by $\widehat{\mathbf{X}} = \mathbf{t}_a\mathbf{p}'_a$ and $\widehat{\mathbf{Y}}_a = \mathbf{t}_a \mathbf{c}'_a$.

## Components in PLSR and PCA Differ

![Janes et al, Nat Rev MCB, 2006](./figs/plsr/PC-8.webp)

## Determining the Number of Components

R2X provides the variance explained in X:

$$ R^2X = 1 - \frac{\lvert X_{\textrm{PLSR}} - X \rvert }{\lvert X \rvert} $$

R2Y shows the Y variance explained:

$$ R^2Y = 1 - \frac{\lvert Y_{\textrm{PLSR}} - Y \rvert }{\lvert Y \rvert} $$

If you are trying to predict something, you should look at the cross-validated R2Y (a.k.a. Q2Y).

# Practical Notes & Summary

## PCR

- sklearn does not implement PCR directly
- Can be applied by chaining [`sklearn.decomposition.PCA`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.decomposition.PCA.html) and [`sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression.html)
- See: [`sklearn.pipeline.Pipeline`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.pipeline.Pipeline.html)

## PLSR

- [`sklearn.cross_decomposition.PLSRegression`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.pipeline.Pipeline.html)
	- Uses `M.fit(X, Y)` to train
	- Can use `M.predict(X)` to get new predictions
	- `PLSRegression(n_components=3)` to set number of components on setup
	- Or `M.n_components = 3` after setup

## Comparison

### PLSR

- Maximizes the covariance
- Takes into account both the dependent (Y) and independent (X) data

### PCR

- Uses PCA as initial decomp. step, then is just normal linear regression
- Maximizes the variance explained of the independent (X) data

## Performance

- PLSR is amazingly well at prediction
	- This is **incredibly** powerful
- Interpreting **why** PLSR predicts something can be challenging
