# Ordinary Differential Equations

- ODE models are typically most useful when we already have an idea of the system components
	- As opposed to *data-driven* approaches when we don't know how to connect the data
	- Incredibly powerful for making specific predictions about how a system works
- Limits of these approaches:
	- Results can be extremely sensitive to missing components or model errors
	- Can quickly explode in complexity
	- May rely on variables that are impossible to measure

# Applications of ODE models: Molecular kinetics

Remember BE100!

Let's say we have to ligands that dimerize, then this dimer binds to a receptor as one unit:

$$ L_f + L_f \leftrightarrow L_D $$

$$ L_D + R_f \leftrightarrow R_b $$

If we want to know about how these species interact, we can model their behavior with the rate equations that describe this process.

\note[item]{$ \frac{dL_f}{dt} = -k_1 L_f^2 + k_{-1}L_D $
\item $ \frac{dL_D}{dt} = k_1 L_f^2 - k_2 L_D R_f + k_{-2} R_b $
\item $ \frac{dR_b}{dt} = k_2 L_D R_f - k_{-2} R_b $
\item $ \frac{dR_f}{dt} = k_{-2} R_b - k_2 L_D R_f $

\item What does each compartment represent?
}

# Applications of ODE models: Pharmacokinetics

- Central compartment corresponds to the plasma in the body.
	- $V_1$ is the distribution volume of plasma in the body.
	- $C_1$ is the concentration of drug in the plasma.
- Peripheral compartment represents a group of organs that significantly take up the particular drug.
	- $V_2$ is the volume of these group of organs.
	- $C_2$ is the concentration of drug in the group of organs.

# Applications of ODE models: Pharmacokinetics

- $k_e$ is the rate constant for clearance.
	- $k_e C_1 V_1$ is the mass of drug/time that's cleared.
- $k_1$ is the rate constant for mass transfer from the central to peripheral compartment.
	- $k_1 C_1 V_1$ is the mass of drug/time that transfers from the central to peripheral compartment.
- $k_2$ is the rate constant for mass transfer from the peripheral to central compartment.
	- $k_2 C_2 V_2$ is the mass of drug/time that transfers from the peripheral to the central compartment.


# Applications of ODE models: Pharmacokinetics

- Have a bolus i.v. injection
	- No drug in both compartments for t<0
	- D μg of drug administered at once at t=0
	- Drug distribution occurs instantaneously in the central compartment.
		- Also get well-mixed instantaneously.
		- Concentration in central compartment at $t=0$ is D μg/mL
- No chemical reactions in the compartment

\note{Work out equations above. Going to learn a mathematical trick to solve!}

# Applications of ODE models: Population kinetics

#### Lotka-Volterra Equations

\note{$$\dot{x} = \alpha x - \beta x y$$ $$\dot{y} = \delta x y - \gamma y$$ maybe come back at the end to these}

# Note about difference from other models we've covered

- ODE models can be part of inference techniques just as elsewhere
	- If we have a symbolic integral, then fitting an ODE model to data is just non-linear least squares
- But we often don't have a symbolic expression of the answer
	- Have to simulate the model every time
	- Can only focus on the input-output we get from the black box
- In this respect, what we do with ODE models will be very similar to what you could do with any computational simulation

# Analytic vs Numerical Modeling

- Analytic
	- Wider range of parameters
	- Avoid numerical problems
	- Physical intuition more direct
	- Often must simplify model
- Numerical
	- Can handle complex models
	- Dependence on parameters & initial conditions
	- Physical insight may be difficult to extract
	- Convergence, numerical stability

Reality often requires handling in between:

- Use analytic treatment to study entire parameter space
- Use numerical treatment to study interesting regions
- Use both to handle complex behavior


# Stability Analysis

- Can solve for steady-states of a system $$\frac{\delta F}{\delta t} = 0$$
- Results of this can be both stable or unstable points
	- With stable points, slope of $\frac{\delta F}{\delta t}$ is negative
	- In multivariate case, this means eigenvalues of Jacobian are negative
- Steady-state points aren't necessarily realistic or feasible!
	- NNLSQ can solve for points
	- Only simulating system ensures they are accessible

\note{Walk through 1D case of stability.}

# Generalization

- Linear models are easier to simulate and understand than non-linear
	- Linearity: If $\mathbf{x}_1$ and $\mathbf{x}_2$ are both solutions, then $c_1 \mathbf{x}_1 + c_2 \mathbf{x}_2$ is also a solution
- Linear systems tend to be separable (effective decoupling)
- Non-linear systems exhibit interesting properties

# Linearity & Separability

![ ](./lectures/figs/lec9/nonlin-2a.pdf)

\note[item]{Note how linear systems come to a solution
\item Combined with above relationship, this means we can solve linear systems as a special case}

# Phase Portraits

![ ](./lectures/figs/lec9/nonlin-3.pdf)

Non-linear systems

- No general analytic approach to finding trajectory
- So, goal is to understand qualitative trajectory behavior

# Features in Phase Portraits

![ ](./lectures/figs/lec9/nonlin-3a.pdf)

\note[item]{Fixed Points (A, B, C). Steady states
\item Closed Orbits (D). Periodic solutions
\item Flow patterns in trajectory (A and C are similar to each other, different from B)
\item Stability of fixed points and closed orbits (A, B, and C are unstable, D is stable)}

# Solving a Set of Equations for Phase Portrait

- Numerical computation
	- i.e., Runge-Kutta integration
- Qualitative
	- Sufficient for some purposes
- Analytic
	- Elegant, though not always tractable

# Example – fixed points

![ ](./lectures/figs/lec9/nonlin-4a.pdf)

# Example – stability

#### Step 2: Determine stability of fixed points

- If the systems moves slightly away from each fixed point, will it return or will it move further away?
- Another way to ask the same question is to ask whether, as time approaches infinity, does the system tend toward or away from a given stable point.
- Note $y$ solution must be of form:
	- $y = y_0 e^{-t}$ (because $\dot{y} = \frac{dy}{dt} = -y$)
	- So $y \rightarrow 0$ for $t \rightarrow \infty$
- Thus, $\dot{x} = x + e^{-y}$ becomes $\dot{x} \rightarrow x + 1$ for long times
	- This has exponentially growing solutions
	- Toward $\infty$ for $x > -1$ and $-\infty$ for $x < -1$

**Thus, overall solution grows exponentially in at least one dimension, and so is unstable.**

# Example – nullclines

#### Step 3: Sketch nullclines

Nullclines are the sets of points for which $\dot{x} = 0$ or $\dot{y} = 0$, so flow is either horizontal or vertical.

# Example – computed

#### Step 4: Plot flow lines

![ ](./lectures/figs/lec9/nonlin-6.pdf)

# Existence & Uniqueness

Non-linear $\dot{\mathbf{x}} = f(\mathbf{x})$ and given an initial condition.

- Existence and uniqueness of solution guaranteed if $f$ is continuously differentiable
- Corollary: Trajectories **do not** intersect, because if they did, then there would be two solutions for the same initial condition at the crossing point

# Relevance for Nonlinear Dynamics

- So, we have said that we can find fixed points of nonlinear dynamics, linearize about each fixed point, and characterize the dynamics about each fixed point in the non-linear model by the corresponding linear model.
- Is this always true? Do the nonlinearities ever disturb this approach?
- A theorem can be proven which states
	- That all the regions on the previous slide are “robust” (nodes, spirals, saddles) and correspond between linear and nonlinear models.
	- But that all the lines on the previous slide are “delicate” (centers, stars, degenerate nodes, non-isolated fixed points) and can have different behaviors in linear and non-linear models.

# Bifurcations

- The phase portraits we have been looking at describe the trajectory of the system for a given set of initial conditions. However, for “fixed” parameters (rate constants in eqns, for instance).
- What we might like is a series of phase portraits corresponding to different sets of parameters.
- **Many** will be qualitatively similar. The interesting ones will be where a small change of parameters creates a qualitative change in the phase portrait (bifurcations).
- What we will find is that fixed points & closed orbits can be created/destroyed and stabilized/destabilized.

# Saddle-Node Bifurcation

# Genetic Control Network

Griffith (1971) model of genetic control:

- x = protein concentration
- y = mRNA concentration

![ ](./lectures/figs/lec9/nonlin-11.pdf)

# Genetic Control Network

Biochemical version of a bistable switch:

1. Only stable points are no protein and mRNA or a fixed composition
2. If degradation rates too great, only stable point is origin

![ ](./lectures/figs/lec9/nonlin-12.pdf)

\note[item]{How could we compare this to data?
\item Measure steady-state
\item Start at points and see bifurcation
\item Measure over time}

# Implementation - Testing

- Many properties one can test
	- Mass balance
	- Changes upon parameter adjustment
- Good to test these before and after integration

\note{Go through example of mass balance at deriv and solution.}

# Implementation

SciPy provides two interfaces for ODE solving:

- [scipy.integrate.ode](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.integrate.ode.html)
- [scipy.integrate.odeint](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.integrate.odeint.html)

Notes:

- Both can solve stiff and non-stiff equations.
- ode has a number of different methods. Pay attention to the "set_integrator" option.

# Implementation - Example

The second order differential equation for the angle $\theta$ of a pendulum acted on by gravity with friction can be written:

$$\theta''(t) + b*\theta'(t) + c*\sin(\theta(t)) = 0$$

where b and c are positive constants, and a prime (‘) denotes a derivative. To solve this equation with `odeint`, we must first convert it to a system of first order equations. By defining the angular velocity $\omega(t) = \theta'(t)$, we obtain the system:

$$\theta'(t) = \omega(t)$$

$$\omega'(t) = -b*\omega(t) - c*\sin(\theta(t))$$

# Implementation - Example

Let y be the vector $[\theta, \omega]$. We implement this system in python as:

```python
def pend(y, t, b, c):
    theta, omega = y
    dydt = [omega, -b*omega - c*np.sin(theta)]
    return dydt
```

We assume the constants are $b = 0.25$ and $c = 5.0$:

```python
b, c = 0.25, 5.0
```

# Implementation - Example

For initial conditions, we assume the pendulum is nearly vertical with $\theta(0) = \pi - 0.1$, and it initially at rest, so $\omega(0) = 0$. Then the vector of initial conditions is

```python
y0 = [np.pi - 0.1, 0.0]
```

We generate a solution 101 evenly spaced samples in the interval $0 \leq t \leq 10$. So our array of times is:

```python
t = np.linspace(0, 10, 101)
```

# Implementation - Example

Call odeint to generate the solution. To pass the parameters b and c to `pend`, we give them to `odeint` using the `args` argument.

```python
from scipy.integrate import odeint
sol = odeint(pend, y0, t, args=(b, c))
```

The solution is an array with shape (101, 2). The first column is $\theta(t)$, and the second is $\omega(t)$. The following code plots both components.

# Implementation - Example

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.plot(t, sol[:, 0], 'b', label='theta(t)')
plt.plot(t, sol[:, 1], 'g', label='omega(t)')
plt.legend(loc='best')
plt.xlabel('t')
plt.grid()
plt.show()
```

# Implementation - Stiff Systems

- Very roughly, most ODE solvers take steps inversely proportional to the rate at which the state is changing
- For systems where there are two processes operating on differing timescales, this can be problematic
	- If everything happens really fast, the system will come to equilibrium quickly
	- If everything is slow, you can take longer steps
- *Stiff* solvers additionally require the Jacobian matrix
	- This very roughly allows them to keep track of these differences in timescales
- `odeint` can automatically find this for you
	- Sometimes it's faster/better to provide this as parameter `Dfun`

# Implementation - Matrix Exponential

If $J$ is the Jacobian matrix of an ODE model, $y(t) = e^{Jt} y_0$.

Matrix exponential is also implemented.

- [scipy.linalg.expm](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-0.15.1/reference/generated/scipy.linalg.expm.html)
	- This method is numerically stable, but there are faster implementations elsewhere.
- A commonly used package is [expokit](https://www.maths.uq.edu.au/expokit/)

For linear systems, this can be >1000x faster.
