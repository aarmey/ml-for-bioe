# Clustering

- Unsupervised learning
- Requires data, but no labels
- Detect patterns e.g. in
	- Gene expression between patient samples
	- Images
	- Really any sets of measurements across samples
- Useful when don’t know what you’re looking for
- But: **can be gibberish**

# Clustering

- Basic idea: group together similar instances
- Example: 2D point patterns

Go over what is the data input and output (discrete).

# What could "similar" mean?

- One option: Euclidean distance

$$ \textrm{dist}(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y}) = \lVert \mathbf{x} - \mathbf{y} \rVert $$

- Clustering results are **completely** dependent on the measure of similarity (or distance) between "points" to be clustered

# What properties should a distance measure have?

- Symmetric
	- $D(A, B) = D(B, A)$
	- Otherwise we can say A looks like B but not vice-versa
- Positivity and self-similarity
	- $D(A,B) > 0$, and $D(A,B)=0$ iff $A=B$
	- Otherwise there will be objects that we can't tell apart
- Triangle inequality
	- $D(A, B) + D(B, C) \geq D(A,C)$
	- Otherwise one can say "A is like B, B is like C, but A is not like C at all"

Critical step is right here. How do we pick what is close? Which is closer?

- Can be slow for very large numbers of data points.
- Can use stochastic sampling in some cases.

# Properties of K-means algorithm

- Guaranteed to converge in a finite number of iterations
- Running time per iteration:
	1. Assign data points to closest cluster center:
		- **O(KN) time**
	2. Change the cluster center to the average of its assigned points:
		- **O(N) time**

# K-Means Convergence

**Objective:** $\min_{\mu}\min_{C}\sum_{i=1}^k \sum_{x\in C_i} \lVert x - \mu_i \rVert^2$

1. Fix $\mu$, optimize $C$: $$\min_C \sum_{i=1}^k \sum_{x\in C_i} \lVert x - \mu_i \rVert^2 = \min_C \sum_{i}^n \lVert x_i - \mu_{x_i} \rVert^2$$
2. Fix $C$, optimize $\mu$: $$\min_{\mu}\sum_{i=1}^k \sum_{x\in C_i} \lVert x - \mu_i \rVert^2$$
	- Take partial derivative of $\mu_i$ and set to zero, we have $$\mu_i = \frac{1}{\lVert C_i \rVert} \sum_{x \in C_i} x$$

Kmeans takes an alternating optimization approach. Each step is guaranteed to decrease the objective—thus guaranteed to converge.

# Initialization

::: columns

:::: column
K-means algorithm is a heuristic:

- Requires initial means
- It does matter what you pick!
- What can go wrong?
- **Various schemes for preventing this kind of thing:** variance-based split / merge, initialization heuristics

- Show example data.
- What would within-cluster distance look like in the ideal case?

- This is the kernel method.
- Will use again with SVMs!

# Agglomerative Clustering

::: columns

:::: {.column width=60%}
- Agglomerative clustering:
	- First merge very similar instances
	- Incrementally build larger clusters out of smaller clusters
- Algorithm:
	- Maintain a set of clusters
	- Initially, each instance in its own cluster
	- Repeat:
		- Pick the two closest clusters
		- Merge them into a new cluster
		- Stop when there’s only one cluster left
- Produces not one clustering, but a family of clusterings represented by a dendrogram

# Agglomerative Clustering

- How should we define “closest” for clusters with multiple elements?
- Many options:
	- Closest pair (single-link clustering)
	- Farthest pair (complete-link clustering)
	- Average of all pairs
- Different choices create different clustering behaviors

# Agglomerative Clustering Questions

- Will agglomerative clustering converge?
	- To a global optimum?
- Will it always find the true patterns in the data?
- Do people ever use it?
- How many clusters to pick?

# Reconsidering “hard assignments”?

- Clusters may overlap
- Some clusters may be “wider” than others
- Distances can be deceiving!

# Applications

- Clustering patients into groups based on molecular or eitiological measurements
- Cells into groups based on molecular measurements
- Neuronal signals

::: notes
- We use clusters because they (hopefully) translate to meaningful differences.
- What if you cluster based on different measurements?
