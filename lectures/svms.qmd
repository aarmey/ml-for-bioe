# History Of SVM

- SVM is related to statistical learning theory
- First introduced in 1992
- Became popular because of its success in handwritten digit recognition
	- 1.1% test error rate for SVM. Same error as a perceptron model.
	- Also used in very first self-driving cars
	- Later bested by deep learning methods
- Note: the meaning of "kernel" is different from other methods

# What Is A Good Decision Boundary?

#### Consider a two-class, linearly separable classification problem

- Many decision boundaries!
- Are all decision boundaries equally good?

Let's say we have this data. How do we draw the decision boundaries?

::: {.notes}
Which points most define where we should draw a boundary?
:::

# Large-Margin Decision Boundary

- The decision boundary should be as far away from the data of both classes as possible
- We should maximize the margin, $m = 2 / \lVert \mathbf{w} \rVert$
- Distance between the origin and the line $\mathbf{w}^T\mathbf{x}=k$ is $k / \lVert \mathbf{w} \rVert$

![ ](./figs/svms/findboundary.png){ width=60% }

# Finding The Decision Boundary

- Let $\{x_1, \ldots, x_n\}$ be our data set and let $y_i \in \{1, -1\}$ be the class label of $x_i$
- The decision boundary should classify all points correctly
	- $y_i \left(\mathbf{w}^T \mathbf{x}_i + b\right) \ge 1, \quad \forall i$
- The decision boundary can be found by solving the following constrained optimization problem:
	- Minimize $\frac{1}{2}\lVert \mathbf{w} \rVert^2$
	- subject to $y_i \left(\mathbf{w}^T \mathbf{x}_i + b\right) \ge 1$
- This is a constrained optimization problem
- Quick methods to find the global optimum by quadratic programming

::: {.notes}
- So $w^T$ and $b$ can vary.
- Want to minimize $\lVert \mathbf{w} \rVert$ so as to maximize the margin.
:::

# The Quadratic Programming Problem

#### Many approaches have been proposed

- Most are "interior-point" methods
	- Start with an initial solution that can violate the constraints
	- Improve this solution by optimizing the objective function and/or reducing the amount of constraint violation
- For SVM, sequential minimal optimization (SMO) seems to be the most popular
	- A QP with two variables is trivial to solve
	- Each iteration of SMO picks a pair of ($\alpha_i, \alpha_j$) and solve the QP with these two variables; repeat until convergence
- In practice, we can just regard the QP solver as a "black-box" without bothering how it works

# Characteristics Of The Solution

- Many of the $\alpha_i$ are zero
	- **w** is a linear combination of a small number of data points
	- This "sparse" representation can be viewed as data compression as in the construction of knn classifier
- $x_i$ with non-zero $\alpha_i$ are called support vectors (SV)
	- The decision boundary is determined only by the SV
	- Let $t_j (j=1, \ldots, s)$ be the indices of the s support vectors
	- We can write $\mathbf{w} = \sum_{j=1}^{s} \alpha_{t_{j}}y_{t_{j}}\mathbf{x}_{t_{j}}$
- For testing with a new data **z**
	- Compute $\mathbf{w}^T \mathbf{z} + b = \sum_{j=1}^{s} \alpha_{t_{j}}y_{t_{j}}\left( \mathbf{x}_{t_{j}}^T \mathbf{z} \right) + b$
	- Classify **z** as class 1 if the sum is positive, and class 2 otherwise
	- Note: **w** need not be formed explicitly

# A Geometrical Interpretation

![ ](./figs/svms/ageomint.png){ width=70% }

# Non-Linearly Separable Problems

- We allow “error” $\xi_i$ in classification; it is based on the output of the discriminant function $\mathbf{w}^T\mathbf{x} + b$
- ξi approximates the number of misclassified samples

![ ](./figs/svms/nonsep.png){ width=70% }

::: {.notes}
- We can just move the points!
- But then how do we choose the answer?
:::

# Soft Margin Hyperplane

- If we minimize $\sum_i \xi_i$, $\xi_i$ can be computed by
	- $(\mathbf{w}^T \mathbf{x}_i + b) \geq 1 - \xi_i \quad y_i = 1$
	- $(\mathbf{w}^T \mathbf{x}_i + b) \leq -1 + \xi_i \quad y_i = -1$
	- $\xi_i \geq 0$
	- $\xi_i$ are “slack variables” in optimization
	- Note that $\xi_i = 0$ if there is no error for $\mathbf{x}_i$
	- $\xi_i$ is an upper bound of the number of errors
- We want to minimize:
	- $\tfrac{1}{2} \lVert \mathbf{w} \rVert^2 + C \sum_{i=1}^{n} \xi_i$
	- $C$: tradeoff parameter between error and margin
- The optimization problem becomes:
	- Minimize $\tfrac{1}{2} \lVert \mathbf{w} \rVert^2 + C \sum_{i=1}^{n} \xi_i$
	- subject to $y_i (\mathbf{w}^T \mathbf{x}_i + b) \geq 1 - \xi_i, \quad \xi_i \geq 0$

::: {.notes}
- Still perfectly classifying the points, after we move them.
:::

# The Optimization Problem

- The dual of this new constrained optimization problem is:
	- max. $W(\alpha) = \sum_{i=1}^n \alpha_i - \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1,j=1}^n \alpha_i \alpha_j y_i y_j \mathbf{x}_i^T \mathbf{x}_j$
	- subject to $C \geq \alpha_i \geq 0, \sum_{i=1}^n \alpha_i y_i = 0$
- **w** is recovered as $\mathbf{w} = \sum_{j=1}^s \alpha_{t_j} y_{t_j} \mathbf{x}_{t_j}$
- This is very similar to the optimization problem in the linear separable case, except that there is an upper bound $C$ on $\alpha_i$ now
- Once again, a QP solver can be used to find $\alpha_i$

::: {.notes}
- In a minute, it will become important that $\mathbf{x}$ really only shows up in one place.
:::

# Extension To Non-linear Decision Boundary

- So far, we have only considered large-margin classifier with a linear decision boundary
- How to generalize it to become nonlinear?
- Key idea: transform $\mathbf{x}_i$ to a higher dimensional space to "make life easier"
	- Input space: the space the point $\mathbf{x}_i$ are located
	- Feature space: the space of φ($\mathbf{x}_i$) after transformation
- Why transform?
	- Linear operation in the feature space is equivalent to non-linear operation in input space
	- Classification can become easier with a proper transformation.

::: {.notes}
Go over circle inside circle with transformation to polar coordinates.

# Transforming The Data

![ ](./figs/svms/transdata.svg)

- Note that feature space is usually of higher dimensions in practice
- Computation in the feature space can be costly because it is high dimensional
	- The feature space is typically infinite-dimensional!
- The kernel trick comes to rescue

# The Kernel Trick

- Recall the SVM optimization problem

- The data points only appear as the inner product
	- max. $W(\alpha) = \sum_{i=1}^n \alpha_i - \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1,j=1}^n \alpha_i \alpha_j y_i y_j \mathbf{x}_i^T \mathbf{x}_j$
	- subject to $C \geq \alpha_i \geq 0, \sum_{i=1}^n \alpha_i y_i = 0$
- As long as we can calculate the inner product in the feature space, we do not need the mapping explicitly
- Many common geometric operations (angles, distances) can be expressed by inner products
- Define the kernel function $K$ by: $$K(x_i, x_j) = \phi \left(x_i\right)^T \phi \left(x_j\right)$$

::: {.notes}
- We don't even necessarily need to calculate something that involves the data.
- All that matters is the kernel value.
:::

# Kernel Functions

- In practical use of SVM, the user specifies the kernel function; the transformation φ(.) is not explicitly stated
- Given a kernel function $K(x_i, x_j)$, the transformation φ(.) is given by its eigenfunctions (a concept in functional analysis)
	- Eigenfunctions can be difficult to construct explicitly
	- This is why people only specify the kernel function without worrying about the exact transformation
- Another view: kernel function, being an inner product, is really a similarity measure between the objects

# Examples of Kernel Functions

- Polynomial kernel with degree $d$
	- $K(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}) = \left( \mathbf{x}^T \mathbf{y} + 1 \right)^d$
- Radial basis function kernel with width $\sigma$
	- $K(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}) = \exp (-\lVert \mathbf{x} - \mathbf{y} \rVert^2 / (2\sigma^2))$
	- Closely related to radial basis function neural networks
	- The feature space is infinite-dimensional
- Sigmoid with parameter $\kappa$ and $\theta$
	- $K(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}) = \tanh (\kappa \mathbf{x}^T \mathbf{y} + \theta)$

# Modification Due to Kernel Function

- Change all inner products to kernel functions
- For training:
	- Original: max. $W(\alpha) = \sum_{i=1}^n \alpha_i - \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1,j=1}^n \alpha_i \alpha_j y_i y_j \mathbf{x}_i^T \mathbf{x}_j$
	- With kernel function: max. $W(\alpha) = \sum_{i=1}^n \alpha_i - \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1,j=1}^n \alpha_i \alpha_j y_i y_j K\left( \mathbf{x}_i^T \mathbf{x}_j \right)$
	- Both: subject to $C \geq \alpha_i \geq 0, \sum_{i=1}^n \alpha_i y_i = 0$

# Modification Due to Kernel Function

- For testing, the new data **z** is classified as class 1 if $f \geq 0$, and class 2 if $f < 0$
- Original:
	- $\mathbf{w} = \sum_{j=1}^{s} \alpha_{t_{j}}y_{t_{j}}\mathbf{x}_{t_{j}}$
	- $f = \mathbf{w}^T \mathbf{z} + b = \sum_{j=1}^{s} \alpha_{t_{j}}y_{t_{j}}\left( \mathbf{x}_{t_{j}}^T \mathbf{z} \right) + b$
- With kernel function:
	- $\mathbf{w} = \sum_{j=1}^{s} \alpha_{t_{j}}y_{t_{j}} \phi\left(\mathbf{x}_{t_{j}}\right)$
	- $f = \langle \mathbf{w}, \phi\left(\mathbf{z}\right) \rangle + b = \sum_{j=1}^{s} \alpha_{t_{j}}y_{t_{j}}K\left( \mathbf{x}_{t_{j}}^T, \mathbf{z} \right) + b$

# More on Kernel Functions

- Since the training of SVM only requires the value of $K(\mathbf{x}_i, \mathbf{x}_j)$, there is no restriction of the form of $\mathbf{x}_i$ and $\mathbf{x}_j$
	- $\mathbf{x}_i$ can be a sequence or a tree, instead of a feature vector
- $K(\mathbf{x}_i, \mathbf{x}_j)$ is just a similarity measure comparing $\mathbf{x}_i$ and $\mathbf{x}_j$
- For a test object **z**, the discrimination function essentially is a weighted sum of the similarity between **z** and a pre-selected set of objects (the support vectors):
	- $f(\mathbf{z}) = \sum_{\mathbf{x}_i \in S}\alpha_i y_i K(\mathbf{z}, \mathbf{x}_i) + b$
	- S: the set of support vectors

# Justification of SVM

- Large margin classifier
- Ridge regression: the term $\tfrac{1}{2}\lVert w \rVert^2$ “shrinks” the parameters towards zero to avoid overfitting
- The term the term $\tfrac{1}{2}\lVert w \rVert^2$ can also be viewed as imposing a weight-decay prior on the weight vector

# Choosing the Kernel Function

- Probably the most tricky part of using SVM
- The kernel function is important because it creates the kernel matrix, which summarizes all the data
- In practice, a low degree polynomial kernel or RBF kernel with a reasonable width is a good initial try

# Other Aspects of SVM

- How to use SVM for multi-class classification?
	- One can change the QP formulation to become multi-class
	- More often, multiple binary classifiers are combined
	- One can train multiple one-versus-all classifiers, or combine multiple pairwise classifiers “intelligently”
- How to interpret the SVM discriminant function value as probability?
	- By performing logistic regression on the SVM output of a set of data (validation set) that is not used for training

# Summary

# Classification steps

- Prepare the pattern matrix
- Select the kernel function to use
- Select the parameter of the kernel function and the value of C
	- You can use the values suggested by the SVM software, or you can set apart a validation set to determine the values of the parameter
- Execute the training algorithm and obtain the $\alpha_i$
- Unseen data can be classified using the $\alpha_i$ and the support vectors

# Strengths and weaknesses of SVM

- Strengths
	- Training is relatively easy
		-  No local optimal, unlike in neural networks
	- It scales well to high dimensional data
	- Tradeoff between classifier complexity and error can be controlled explicitly
	- Non-traditional data like strings and trees can be used as input to SVM, instead of feature vectors
- Weaknesses
	- Need to choose a “good” kernel function.
	- Not generative
	- Difficult to interpret
	- Need fully labelled data

## Other types of kernel methods

- **Key lesson:** a linear algorithm in the feature space is equivalent to a non-linear algorithm in the input space
- Standard linear algorithms can be generalized to its non-linear version by going to the feature space
- Kernel principal component analysis, kernel independent component analysis, kernel canonical correlation analysis, kernel k-means, 1-class SVM are some examples

## Multi-class classification

- SVM is basically a two-class classifier
- One can change the QP formulation to allow multi-class classification
- More commonly, one splits the classes into binary decisions

## Implementation

sklearn has implementations for a variety of SVM methods:

- `sklearn.svm.SVC`
	- Performs single or multi-class classification
		- Multi-class is through one-vs-one scheme
	- Multiple kernels available
		- `linear`: $\langle x, x'\rangle$
		- `polynomial`: $(\gamma \langle x, x'\rangle + r)^d$
		- `rbf`: $\exp(-\gamma \|x-x'\|^2)$
		- `sigmoid`: $\tanh(\gamma \langle x,x'\rangle + r)$
- Alternative implementations
	- `sklearn.svm.NuSVC`
		- Additionally provides parameter to control number of support parameters
	- `sklearn.svm.LinearSVC`
		- Only support for linear kernel, with better scaling/options
		- For example can provide l1 or l2 regularization
		- Scales better for many samples
