# Outline

- Administrative Issues
- Decomposition methods
	- Factor analysis
	- Principal components analysis
	- Non-negative matrix factorization

# Dealing with many variables

- So far we've largely concentrated on cases in which we have relatively large numbers of measurements for a few variables
	- This is frequently refered to as $n > p$
- Two other extremes are imporant
	- Many observations and many variables
	- Many variables but few observations ($p > n$)

# Dealing with many variables

## Usually when we're dealing with many variables, we don't have a great understanding of how they relate to each other

- E.g. if gene X is high, we can't be sure that will mean gene Y will be too
- If we had these relationships, we could reduce the data
	- E.g. if we had variables to tell us it's 3 pm in Los Angeles, we don't need one to say it's daytime

# Dimensionality Reduction

## Generate a low-dimensional encoding of a high-dimensional space

Purposes:

- Data compression / visualization
- Robustness to noise and uncertainty
- Potentially easier to interpret

Bonus: Many of the other methods from the class can be applied after dimensionality reduction with little or no adjustment!

# Matrix Factorization

Many (most?) dimensionality reduction methods involve matrix factorization

Basic Idea: Find two (or more) matrices whose product best approximate the original matrix

Low rank approximation to original $N\times M$ matrix:

$$ \mathbf{X} \approx \mathbf{W} \mathbf{H}^{T} $$

where $\mathbf{W}$ is $N\times R$, $\mathbf{H}^{T}$ is $M\times R$, and $R \ll N$.

\note{What is the implicit assumption here?}

# Matrix Factorization

Generalization of many methods (e.g., SVD, QR, CUR, Truncated SVD, etc.)

# Aside - What should R be?

$$ \mathbf{X} \approx \mathbf{W} \mathbf{H}^{T} $$

where $\mathbf{W}$ is $M\times R$, $\mathbf{H}^{T}$ is $M\times R$, and $R \ll N$.

\note[item]{Reduced R simplifies the model substantially
\item Also decreases fidelity of reconstruction
\item Trade-off always

# Matrix Factorization

#### Matrix factorization is also compression

\note[item]{There is always information lost
\item We just hope for it to be information that doesn't matter
}

# Examples from bioengineering

### Process control
- Large bioreactor runs may be recorded in a database, along with a variety of measurements from those runs
- We may be interested in how those different runs varied, and how each factor relates to one another
- Plotting a compressed version of that data can indicate when an anomolous change is present


# Examples from bioengineering

### Mutational processes
- Anytime multiple contributory factors give rise to a phenomena, matrix factorization can separate them out
- Will talk about this in greater detail

### Cell heterogeneity
- Enormous interest in understanding how cells are similar or different
- Answer to this can be in millions of different ways
- But cells often follow *programs*

# Principal Components Analysis

## Application of matrix factorization

- Each principal component (PC) is linear combination of **uncorrelated** attributes / features'
- Ordered in terms of variance
- $k$th PC is orthogonal to all previous PCs
- Reduce dimensionality while maintaining maximal variance

# Methods to calculate PCA

- Iterative computation
	- More robust with high numbers of variables
	- Slower to calculate
- NIPALS (Non-linear iterative partial least squares)
	- Able to efficiently calculate a few PCs at once
	- Breaks down for high numbers of variables (large p)

# Practical Notes

## PCA

- Implemented within `sklearn.decomposition.PCA`
	- `PCA.fit_transform(X)` fits the model to `X`, then provides the data in principal component space
	- `PCA.components_` provides the "loadings matrix", or directions of maximum variance
	- `PCA.explained_variance_` provides the amount of variance explained by each component

\note{Go over explained variance.}

# PCA

~~~python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn import datasets
from sklearn.decomposition import PCA

iris = datasets.load_iris()

X = iris.data
y = iris.target
target_names = iris.target_names

pca = PCA(n_components=2)
X_r = pca.fit(X).transform(X)

# Print PC1 loadings
print(pca.components_[:, 0])
# ...
~~~

# PCA

~~~python
# ...
pca = PCA(n_components=2)
X_r = pca.fit(X).transform(X)

# Print PC1 loadings
print(pca.components_[:, 0])

# Print PC1 scores
print(X_r[:, 0])

# Percentage of variance explained for each component
print(pca.explained_variance_ratio_)
# [ 0.92461621  0.05301557]
~~~

# Non-negative matrix factorization

## Like PCA, except the coefficients in the linear combination must be non-negative

- Forcing positive coefficients implies an additive combination of basis parts to reconstruct whole
- Generally leads to zeros for factors that don't contribute

# Non-negative matrix factorization

## The answer you get will always depend on the error metric, starting point, and search method

BOARD

# What is significant about this?

- The update rule is multiplicative instead of additive
- In the initial values for W and H are non-negative, then W and H can never become negative
- This guarantees a non-negative factorization
- Will converge to a local maxima
	- Therefore starting point matters

# Non-negative matrix factorization

## The answer you get will always depend on the error metric, starting point, and search method

- Another approach is to find the gradient across all the variables in the matrix
- Called coordinate descent, and is usually faster
- Not going to go through implementation
- Will also converge to a local maxima

# Practical Notes - NMF

- Implemented within `sklearn.decomposition.NMF`.
	- `n_components`: number of components
	- `init`: how to initialize the search
	- `solver`: 'cd' for coordinate descent, or 'mu' for multiplicative update
	- `l1_ratio`: Can regularize fit
- Provides:
	- `NMF.components_`: components x features matrix
	- Returns transformed data through `NMF.fit_transform()`

# Summary

## PCA

- Preserves the covariation within a dataset
- Therefore mostly preserves axes of maximal variation
- Number of components can varyâ€”in practice more than 2 or 3 rarely helpful

## NMF

- Explains the dataset through factoring into two **non-negative** matrices
- Much more stable and well-specified reconstruction when assumptions are appropriate
- Excellent for separating out additive factors

# Closing

**As always, selection of the appropriate method depends upon the question being asked.**
