## Final Report

Your final report should be less than 1500 words and describe the following items:

- Introduction/Motivation:
    - Why the topic you choose is interesting
    - Whether similar work has been done by others (novelty will not affect your grade, but it is always good to know if other people are doing the same thing)
- Problem definition
    - How to formulate your topic/question into a data analytics problem
    - How does it relate to a broader biomedical challenge
- Methods
    - Description of the algorithm you employed or designed
    - The software package you chose or your own implementation of the algorithm
    - How to use the software package or your own code
    - (Optional) Charting and/or visualization that help make decisions in your analysis
- Results
    - Quantitative evaluation of your method
    - Charting and/or visualization of your results
    - How your proposed approach has solved your question

Your analysis code should accompany your final report in the git repository.
